			<h8>SANTA MONICA PIER</h8>
				<p>The Santa Monica Pier is a prominent, 100-year-old landmark. It's the huge pier with the ferris wheel that you see in all the TV shows and movies. You'll be able to say you've been there next time you see it on TV. I've never actually been on the ferris wheel, but I'm sure it's exciting if you're not afraid of heights! Check out the original Hot Dog on a Stick stand, try the traveling rings (I will be very impressed if you can do those), rent a tandem bike (extremely difficult to start..), or try surfing! Visit the Third Street Promenade after for some shopping!</p><br>
			<h8>VENICE BEACH</h8>
				<p>Just down the street from the Santa Monica Pier is Venice Beach (you can walk/bike from Santa Monica), basically a beachfront neighborhood full of weed. But really pretty! Check out the Venice Canals! Get a piercing or a tattoo (or both) to show off at the wedding! I guarantee that your mother will love it. Mine would.</p><br>
			<h8>HOLLYWOOD</h8>
				<p>No. Contrary to popular belief, it's actually pretty dirty and grungy. Maybe that's just me though.</p><br>
			<h8>RODEO DRIVE</h8>
				<p>Only visit if you are willing to spend your life savings on a pair of shoes. Unless you would like to buy the bride (or me) some Christian Louboutins as a wedding gift. Otherwise, just stick to the registry and the normal mall.</p><br>
			<h8>GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY</h8>
				<p>The Griffith Observatory sits on the south-facing sope of Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park. Very cool, very educational. My favorite part is the enormous periodic table! See what the elements actually look like. And the whole thing lights up. SO COOL.</p><br>
			<h8>HIKE TO THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN</h8>
				<p>Or ride a horse up! It's a pretty easy hike. But those signs at the top that tell you not to climb the fence? SERIOUSLY DO NOT CLIMB THE FENCE. We know someone who almost didn't make it. A helicopter will most likely not come rescue you like in the movies. There is no phone reception there. Best of luck.</p><br>
			<h8>THE GETTY / GETTY VILLA</h8>
				<p>Go. It's beautiful. And free. Don't be noisy or disturb the peace. You will get thrown out.</p><br>
			<h8>DISNEYLAND</h8>
				<p>If you have never been here, you are clearly not a happy person. Because this is THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH. No further explanation needed. Eat a giant turkey leg and then go on the teacups. It will be the most hilarious thing of your life. The Haunted Mansion is the scariest thing ever. I thought I was going to die once. Ask the groom how that happened. Please mind the 14MPH rule in the parking lots. Strictly enforced. You will most likely spend at least a half hour searching for your car after exiting the park. I know it's expensive, but IT IS WORTH IT. Even this weird kid from Illinois liked it.</p><br>
			<h8>UCLA</h8>
				<p>I saved the best for last. YOU MUST GO HERE. It's a beautiful place. Royce Hall is iconic. It was recently in the Jack in the Box commercial. Just be prepared for all the hills. You will be sweating bullets by the end of your tour. Even if it's cold and raining. You HAVE TO try Rendezvous nachos. BEST THING EVER. NOT A JOKE.</p><br>

			<h8>------------------------</h8><br><br>

			<h8>TSUJITA LA</h8>
				<p>Tsukemen. My favorite. It's delicious. Only open from 11AM-2PM, so get there early! Or else you will stand in line for forever. But if you do have to stand in line, WAIT FOR IT.</p><br>
			<h8>SHIN-SEN-GUMI</h8>
				<p>I'm not sure that the hyphens are in the correct place. Really, this is the only ramen place I truly like. YUM.</p><br>
			<h8>TENDER GREENS</h8>
				<p>So good that I had my graduation dinner here. It's not all salad, I promise. So much butter in those mashed potatoes.</p><br>
			<h8>GUSHI's</h8>
				<p>Korean meat and rice for cheap. Don't let the little shack fool you.</p><br>
			<h8>KOREAN BBQ</h8>
				<p>I don't actually know the names of any places, but just pick one in K-Town and you can't go wrong. AYCE meat for $10. Need I say more? Probably not a good choice if you're vegetarian. You will smell like meat for days, so wear clothes you don't care about. For the best experience, bring a Korean who speaks Korean - only let the Korean speak (in Korean) while ordering food.</p><br>
			<h8>BACHI BURGER</h8>
				<p>Newly opened in California! Prior to this, it was only in Vegas. I waited a year and a half for it to open. But they didn't. I moved out of LA, and then they opened. Thanks a lot.</p><br>
			<h8>ROSCOE'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES</h8>
				<p>I love fried chicken. So much.</p><br>
			<h8>PORTO'S</h8>
				<p>Guava-cheese strudels (among other things) from this Cuban family-style bakery and cafe. Are amazing. On our way to Disneyland, I always make Jordan stop here. There are multiple locations, so no excuses.</p><br>
			<h8>BOTTEGA LOUIE</h8>
				<p>A little more on the pricy side, but their portobello fries are THE BEST. I realize that most people don't like mushrooms, but. You should. Really. & they sell macarons if you like that. The portobello fries are much better than the macarons.</p><br>
			<h8>SALT & STRAW / MILK / SWEET ROSE CREAMERY / FOSSELMAN'S</h8>
				<p>There's something wrong with you if you don't like ice cream. I'm sorry if I'm offending guests. Eek. Salt & Straw is originally from Portland, I saw a celebrity at Milk once, Sweet Rose has two very different locations, and you should visit the Omine's while you're at Fosselman's!</p><br>
			<h8>PHILZ / BLUE BOTTLE</h8>
				<p>For your coffee fix. These places, because I'm from NorCal.</p><br>
			<h8>IN-N-OUT</h8>
				<p>I would normally say you have to try this if you're not from California, but for this occassion, DO NOT GO HERE. SERIOUSLY. I WILL BE UPSET IF YOU DO. Unless you love it so much at the wedding that you want to go again after. Then, fine.</p><br>

			<h8>------------------------</h8><br><br>

			<p>These are by no means the top places to eat at in LA. I just like them. I apologize if you want to venture outside of West LA. Apparently I didn't wander too far in college. I also don't have a very healthy diet, so, again, apologies. I think I had too much fun with this. Clearly working very hard at work.</p><br>
