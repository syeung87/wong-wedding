			<h8><b>BRIDESMAIDS</b></h8>
				<p><b>SABRINA YEUNG</b> | Travel Buddy // Our friendship started on the 405 and we have traveled many roads together since. Mostly in traffic, really early in the morning or REALLY late at night. She is my favorite travel buddy! (Sorry, Daniel). Looking forward to our Route 66 adventure!</p><br>
				<p><b>LESLIE JONAN</b> | Tattoo Buddy // We met our first week at UCLA to go to an event together & have stayed together ever since! We have since gotten two tattoos together, including a matching anchor tattoo. Looking forward to more tattoos together! (Maybe. If Daniel lets me).</p><br>
				<p><b>KRISTINA CHEUNG</b> | Dodgers Buddy // We met our freshman year when Les & I were "too cool" for her. But eventually we let her be our friend & now she plans our Dodger outings! Looking forward to more Dodgers (& Disneyland) trips together. LET'S GO DODGERS.</p><br>
				<p><b>MICHELLE KIM</b> | Funny Buddy // Surprise surprise, I also met Michelle my first year at UCLA & she is one of the unniest ladies I know! She was always nice to us youngin's and took us to all the cool places. Looking forward to more good eats & lots of laughs!</p><br>
				<p><b>ESTHER CHAO</b> | Cute Buddy // As I'm sure you've guessed by now, we also met at UCLA. Also in Hedrick Hall. (Apparently Hedrick Hall is a magical place where lifelong friendships are born). Esther loves all things cute, especially when she can draw cute smiley faces on them. Our signature picture pose is even the cutest! Looking forward to more cute things & cute pictures together!</p><br>
			<h8><b>GROOMSMEN</b></h8>
				<p><b>JON OKEYA</b> - I met Jon when we were both young lads. I was drawn to his goofy, carefree personality and he was drawn to my clever wit and mushroom haircut. Spending hours watching countless movies and playing video games, I consider Jon the most unique guy I have ever met, and the unniest o all my friends. What he lacks in athleticism and sports know how, he more than makes up for with his million dollar impressions and heart as big as Mount Everest.</p><br>
				<p><b>DEREK WONG</b> - On the basketball courts is where Derek and I first met, and where we will most likely be found dead. A close companion throughout my life, Derek and I share many common interests - basketball, video games, music, and the Lakers. We have shared countless hours of battles on the basketball court where we have shared blood, sweat and tears. Growing up, and even now, people always think we're brothers. And that pretty much sums up our friendship - brotherhood.</p><br>
				<p><b>LUKE</b> - Another fellow basketball mate. Luke was a part of my Asian league team that was together from third grade until senior year of high school. Now Luke is a weapon of mass destruction, used when a person in the group either says something ridiculous, stupid, or downright insane. One of the greatest, strongest, and most talented guys that I've ever met. I'm glad to have grown up with him my entire life. And have him on my side.</p><br>
				<p><b>SCOTT</b> - Our paths first crossed when he was my Sunday School teacher in third grade. Hands down coolest teacher I've ever met. rom there grew a long lasting friendship / mentorship. Scott was just like one of the guys and would take me, Derek, Luke, and Jon on many adventures where we would make many memories and have tons of fun. Him pouring out his wisdom, sacrificing his time and energy for four goofballs, we owe a lot to Scott. And I am very thankul for his friendship.</p><br>
				<p><b>TIM WONG</b> - The oldest 28 year old I've ever met. Tim is wise beyond his years as a psychologist, a basketball player, and a man. I've always looked up to Tim and always thought of him as the cool older cousin. I was honored when he took me under his wing and made me his protege on the worship team, teaching me everything he knows: slamming on the acoustic guitar, singing like an angel, and scoring hot babes. I love Tim and he's the best cousin / friend a guy could ask for.</p><br>
