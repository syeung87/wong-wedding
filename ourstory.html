			<h8><b>HIS STORY</b></h8>
				<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy and a girl. The boy and girl grew up together, their parents being family friends and all. They went to Venice Church - the land of tradition and mastaches. The young lad and young lass traded giggles when they were being baby sat by the young lad's older sister as they dressed up Micah with mecklaces, earrings, and dresses. However, fate had it, the two weren't supposed to be together yet as the young girl went with the church plant to a far away land - Westlight. The boy, stranded at Venice remained while seeing others lee one by one. It wasn't until he had become a man that the boy reunited with the girl. They had been looking for love in all the wrong places, but God had a plan for them as they found everything they could be looking for in each other. They had long conversations and I mean LONG, full, of laughter, tears, more laughter, and it seemed like time was just whizzing by. Beore we knew it, the boy and girl were head over heels for each other. The boy finally worked up the courage and asked her if she could ever see hersel ending up with a man like him. And she said "OH YES". Music to the boy's ears it was, as he asked the girl to become his first mate on his love boat. Four and a hal years later, the boy knew this was the one he wanted to spend the rest of his lie with. He had seen sunrises and sunsets, but all pales in comparison to her beautiful face and the wondrous smile of that Jordan Tamura. So he set a plan in motion, and a plan it was indeed. He recorded a msuic video that encapsulated both their time together and his love for her. And he knew she would fancy the backyard garage door to beam the movie upon, strung christmas lights all throughout the driveway, and sprinkled rose petals all on the black asphalt. As the boy and girl came back home from a lovely dinner, the boy walked down the driveway hand in hand with the girl of his dreams, sat her down beside him, played the movie and watched the tears fall down her face. At the end of the movie, the screen read, "Will you marry me?" He got down on one knee, ring in hand, as the girl gasps, she says "Yes." And they dance the night away.</p><br><p>THE END.</p><br>
			<h8><b>HER STORY</b></h8>
				<p>I've known Daniel basically my entire life. He's a couple of years older though, so I've always admired him from afar. (Like a lot of other girls. Let's be honest) He was the really cute, older worship leader (how cliche of me) who was a cool kid & definitely too popular for me! Even though our families go way back, I didn't actually know him that well...but I DID know that if he ever asked me out, my answer would be YES. A thousand times yes! So in my sophomore year of college when he asked me "if I would ever go on a date with Daniel", in a less than suave fashion, I immediately said yes, without any hesitation. After that  we spent many nights talking until dawn, laughing & laughing until the sun came up. We just immediately clicked. I felt so comfortable with him from day one. He quickly became my best friend. It didn't take long for me to fall in love with my charming guy.  Even now, 4 1/2 years later, whenever we hang out, time flies because we have so much fun.</p><br>
				<p>We've had our ups and downs but at the end of the day, I know our relationship and Daniel is worth fighting for. I asked for a pearl ring because once when I was going through a really tough time, my mom told me that just as the process of creating a pearl is painful, sometimes we go through painful times so that our lives can be beautiful, like a pearl. So Lord knows our relationship has had some hard times, but in the end I know our relationship can be as beautiful as the pearl ring he gave to me when he got down on one knee.</p><br>
				<p>On October 4th he proposed (after I ruined his first idea, sorry) in my parents backyard. He projected a video (which I love doing), of him lip syncing to a romantic R&B song (which I love), mixed in with pictures and videos from our relationship (which I love), with rose petals everywhere (swoon) and Christmas lights (which I LOVE) while I sipped Philz coffee (which I absolutely love). It was super romantic & thoughtful & amazing & perfect! I couldn't have asked for a more incredible proposal. I am so excited to spend the rest of my life with such a sweet, funny, generous, patient, loving & supercalifragilisticexpialidocious man! I can't believe I'm so lucky to marry THE Daniel Setsuwo Wong. (Also he's the best basketball player I know. He'd want me to add that...And I've met Blake Griffin, so that's saying a lot!)</p><br>
